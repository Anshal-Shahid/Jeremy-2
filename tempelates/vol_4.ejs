                <p>for everyone still with us and to our newcomers, welcome to the dinner party. i'm <a
                        href="">jeremy</a>—chef, restaurateur, author, and guilty creator of email headlines that offend
                    people (i guess some didn’t see god last week after eating my peppers). for those just joining, i’ve
                    spent years cooking around the country, launching restaurants from los angeles to chicago and
                    anywhere that would have me in between. along the way, i picked up two core beliefs: cooking should
                    be fun and easy, and you don’t need to go to culinary school to make a nice meal. <br><br>

                    i have been very outspoken about my love for microwaves, which unfortunately doesn’t vibe with
                    everyone (RIP, anti-microwave friends), but i can safely say that if we’re ever abducted by aliens,
                    it would be via a heating, rotating plate of popping pasta sauce. so, thank you for being a part of
                    the revolution—and special thanks to those who’ve shared this with friends. <br><br>

                    as we settle into week four (and have the privilege of reading every self-proclaimed political
                    expert’s diatribe on the state of the country), it only makes sense to dish out some spice and carbs
                    for this week’s newsletter. we’re about to hit our one-month anniversary of this dinner party, and i
                    can only imagine how emotional you’re feeling right now. we’re also in the process of adding more
                    design elements to this newsletter, so in the next couple of weeks, we’ll be popping up in your
                    inbox with more color and visuals. so, pull your face up to your phone or computer and let me preach
                    about the simplicity of food, recommend some music on the <a href="">DINNER PARTY playlist</a>, and
                    expect to read about anything from grilled cheese as self-care to a story about how an egg scramble
                    saved me from going to the DMV.</p>

                <h1>New York Shuk Rosey Harissa Spice</h1>
                <p>New York Shuk's Rosey Harissa Spice is a fragrant, middle eastern-inspired blend that combines the
                    heat of traditional harissa with a floral twist from dried rose petals. this spice mix offers a
                    balanced blend of chili, cumin, and coriander, with a hint of sweetness from the rose, adding depth
                    and subtle warmth to dishes. perfect for seasoning meats, roasted vegetables, grains, and dips, it
                    brings a unique, aromatic profile to both savory and sweet recipes.
                    you can grab it on Amazon.</p>

                        cooking at home doesn’t need to be complicated. the best meals come from keeping things simple,
                        which is why we’re drawn to comfort food. my goal is to create recipes you’ll actually want to
                        make—and hopefully inspire you to create your own dishes. every week, i’ll share a new recipe
                        you can whip up using just a microwave. you’d be surprised at what’s possible with that alone.
                        <br><br>

                        in the MICROWAVES KILL section, you’ll find quick, tasty, and easy-to-make recipes ranging from
                        5 to 30 minutes.
                        this week’s recipe? spicy harissa creamy rigatoni. like every other recipe, this dish is sure to
                        surprise you—in a good way, hopefully. the depth of flavor in this dish completely outdoes the
                        effort it takes to make. and it only requires one bowl. perfect for college students looking to
                        elevate their late-night spicy ramen cravings.

                                <h4>1. THE PASTA</h4>
                                <p>Place the rigatoni and water in a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high for
                                    4-5 minutes, stirring halfway, until pasta is al dente and most of the water is
                                    absorbed.</p>

                                <h4>2. SAUCE IT UP</h4>
                                <p>Add tomato paste, cream, Rosey Harissa Spice, sun-dried tomatoes, parmesan, garlic
                                    powder, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine all ingredients.</p>

                                <h4>3. MICROWAVE</h4>
                                <p>Microwave on high for 1-2 minutes until the sauce is creamy, and the flavors are
                                    melded. The garlic powder and sun-dried tomatoes will add depth and richness to the
                                    sauce.</p>

                                <h4>4. KILL</h4>
                                <p>Let sit for a minute to thicken. Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle extra parmesan, and
                                    garnish with fresh basil before serving.</p>
                            </div>
